#pros:
#1. it reduces the human effort for coding
#2. easy to write for long datasets
#3. easy to recall

#5. not start to the special character ?, @ ^ $ 
#6. don't use numbers in variables at the beginning
#7. meaningful variables assign math to the data and according to the data
#8. global trends(df) dataframe like stands mean df stand for dataframe
#9. don't ever repeat the same variable (pehlay wala remove ho jana hy)
#10. don't ever use the oporators use in variables (+,-,/,*,**,^)
#11. samosa update to samosa_1, samosa_2
#12. variables can't write like string mean not write in inverted commas don't use "" when use variables
